introduction:
    I am going to make a 1 v 1 BasketBall.
    - future updates maybe {3v3, 5v5}, positions, defense
    -USE PlayerTest.java for MAIN METHOD

    Basic Mechanics
        Shooting: 

        prototype 1

            using random int with percentages

            wide open shots:

                public boolean Shoot(){
                    double pct = Math.random()*100;
                    if((pct -= shootingRate) < 0) return true;
                    else return false;
                }

        prototype 2
